  Term Project : C Programming Language (Undergrad-level)
</h1>

## Notice
- These are the assignments from **C Programming Language Course**, and the copyright of the questions 
belongs to the original author(professor). I only offer the code solutions, and these codes are 
all for education purpose, but if there are any issues with the authorization, please contact me, 
I will immediately remove it.

- Every assignment folder contains : `README.md` and `SolutionApproach.md`, so you won't
get lost in the folder full of code.

- Unfortunately, some of the codes might have some small issues or errors that I haven't fixed them yet, 
so if you are interested in further discussion, please leave the comments.




## Usage

All codes in this repository are used in C langauge.

I used [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) to complete this project.
